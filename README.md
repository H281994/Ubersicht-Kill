# Ubersicht-Kill

Widgets for Ãœbersicht
UPDATE: widgets now live in their own github repo. The old format is still supported, but will be phased out soon.

Got a widget to share? Great, create a github repo for it, then open an issue here and be sure to mention the url. It will get picked up ASAP!

Note:
This is a product that I collected and edited to suit my simple liking...
